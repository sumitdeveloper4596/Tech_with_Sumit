<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 25 November 2025</p>

<p>
Tech With Sumit (TWS) ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to 
protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information 
we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have in connection with our mobile 
application Tech With Sumit (TWS).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Currently the app does not require user registration and does not intentionally collect personal identifiers such as name, email address, or phone number. However, the app may automatically collect the following non-personal data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Device information (device model, OS version, screen resolution)</li>
    <li>App usage data (which screens are viewed, time spent in app)</li>
    <li>Network and connectivity status</li>
    <li>Error logs and crash reports (for debugging and improving the app)</li>
</ul>

<p>These data are collected to analyze usage and improve app stability and performance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Third-Party Content & Services</h2>

<p>The app currently displays educational content using WebView and embedded YouTube videos. These are provided by third parties and are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

<p>
Notably, when you watch YouTube videos, Google may collect usage data according to 
Google's policies. We do not control or store data collected by YouTube/Google.
</p>

<h3>Advertising (Third-Party Ads Inside Websites)</h3>

<p>The app displays advertisements through Google AdMob. These ads are served by Google and may use cookies or device identifiers to provide personalized or non-personalized ads.
Additionally, some third-party websites opened inside the app’s WebView may show their own advertisements, which are controlled and served by the respective website owners, not by us.</p>

<p>We do not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>control these ads</li>
    <li>collect any advertising-related data</li>
    
</ul>

<p>Any data collected by those websites or their advertisers is governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Downloadable Study Material</h2>

<p>The app includes downloadable study materials such as PDFs.  
Downloaded files are saved only within the app's internal storage, meaning:</p>

<ul>
    <li>No external storage or file manager access is required</li>
    <li>No storage permission is requested</li>
    <li>Users cannot access or modify these files outside the app</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not collect, upload, or share any downloaded files.  
These downloads are used solely to provide offline study content within the app.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Future Features (Premium Content & Accounts)</h2>

<p>
In the future we may add features such as paid/premium courses or optional user 
accounts. If we introduce any features that collect personal information, this 
Privacy Policy will be updated and users will be informed before any personal data 
is collected.
</p>

<p>
If accounts are introduced, we will clearly state what information is required 
(for example email for login) and how it will be used.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. How We Use Collected Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To analyze app usage and improve features and performance</li>
    <li>To diagnose and fix crashes and bugs</li>
    <li>To provide and maintain the app experience</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Storage & Security</h2>

<p>
We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information 
against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no 
method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — absolute security cannot be 
guaranteed.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Advertising & Analytics</h2>

<p>Currently the app does not display ads.  
In the future we may use advertising platforms (for example Google AdMob). Third-party ad networks may collect anonymous device identifiers and other data for ad personalization; their practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

<p>
We may also use analytics tools to better understand user behavior. Analytics data 
will be aggregated and anonymized where possible.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>
This app is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect 
personal information from children under 13. If we learn that personal information 
of a child under 13 has been collected without parental consent, we will take steps 
to delete that information.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>
The app may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not 
responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to 
review their privacy policies.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will 
update the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes indicates 
you accept the updated policy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Your Rights</h2>

<p>
Depending on your location you may have rights to access, correct, or delete 
personal information we hold about you. If you wish to exercise such rights, 
please contact us using the details below.
